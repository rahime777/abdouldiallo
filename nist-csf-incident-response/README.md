# NIST CSF Incident Response – DDoS Attack (ICMP Flood)

## Description
This project demonstrates how the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) can be used
to respond to a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack caused by an ICMP flood.

The scenario is based on a simulated security incident involving a misconfigured
firewall that allowed excessive ICMP traffic to overwhelm the network.

## Framework Used
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)

## Incident Type
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)
- ICMP Flood Attack

## Skills Demonstrated
- Incident analysis
- Network security fundamentals
- Firewall configuration concepts
- IDS/IPS usage
- Security incident response
- Risk identification and mitigation

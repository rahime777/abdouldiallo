# Incident Response Report – NIST Cybersecurity Framework ## 1. Incident Summary The organization experienced a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack caused by a flood of ICMP packets. As a result, several network services became unavailable for approximately two hours. The security team mitigated the attack by blocking malicious traffic and disabling lower-priority network services in order to prioritize the restoration of high-priority services. ## 2. Identify The security team investigated the incident and confirmed that the organization was targeted by an ICMP flood attack. The attack overwhelmed the network by sending a large volume of ICMP packets simultaneously from multiple devices. This caused the servers to become unresponsive and unable to handle legitimate user requests. ## 3. Protect To address this security incident, the network security team implemented new firewall rules to limit the rate of incoming ICMP traffic. In addition, an IDS/IPS system was deployed to filter ICMP packets based on suspicious characteristics. ## 4. Detect To detect similar incidents in the future, the team will use network monitoring software to identify abnormal traffic patterns. The IDS/IPS system will also be used to detect and filter suspicious network activity. ## 5. Respond To respond to the incident, the team blocked incoming ICMP traffic and temporarily disabled lower-priority network services. The firewall configuration was updated to contain the attack. The team will also notify law enforcement and other relevant organizations as required by local regulations. ## 6. Recover To recover from the ICMP flooding DDoS attack, network services must be restored to normal operation. Firewall rules can be used to prevent future ICMP flood attacks. Non-essential services should be temporarily stopped to reduce network traffic, allowing essential services to be restored first. Once the ICMP traffic has stopped, all remaining systems and services can be safely brought back online. ## 7. Lessons Learned - Firewall configurations must be reviewed regularly - ICMP traffic should be continuously monitored and rate-limited - Proactive monitoring improves incident response time
